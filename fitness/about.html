                <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
                <p>The following are common exercises we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and jump up from a squatted position</dd>

                    <dt>Plank</dt>
                    <dd>Get into forearm plank position. Ensure your elbows on the ground directly underneath your shoulders with your feet hip-width apart. Make sure your back is flat and your head and neck are in a neutral position. Drive your elbows into the floor, and squeeze your quads, glutes, and core.</dd>

                    <dt>Moutain Climber</dt>
                    <dd>Start by raising your knee to hip level, then drop down to the floor holding a plank position. Perform the basic move, bringing your knee to your chest then back out again. To get your heart rate up, try jogging for a count of 10 before switching to the other side.</dd>
